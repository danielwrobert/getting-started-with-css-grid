	<ul>
		<li>The vertical and horizontal lines that divide the grid and separate the columns and rows.</li>
		<li>Grid lines are numbered left to right and top to bottom.</li>
		<li>They respect the language direction, so if you're coming from an RLT language, they will also be numbered accordingly.</li>
		<li>Tracks are not numbered by the actual column itself, but by the lines that start and stop them. Because of that, you'll always have one more line number than you actually have column or row.'</li>
