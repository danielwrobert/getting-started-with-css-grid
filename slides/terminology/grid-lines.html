	<ul>
		<li>The vertical and horizontal lines that divide the grid and separate the columns and rows.</li>
		<li>Grid lines are numbered left to right and top to bottom.</li>
		<li>They respect the language direction, so if you're coming from an RLT language, they will also be numbered accordingly.</li>
		<li>Grid columns and rows are not numbered by the actual column or row itself, but by the lines that start and stop them.</li>
		<li>Because of that, you'll always have one more line number than you actually have column or row, which is useful to know when placing items, as we'll see in a bit.</li>
