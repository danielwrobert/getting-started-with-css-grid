	<ul>
		<li>And here in our styles, we've explicitly defined 4 columns.</li>
		<li>If we did not define them, we would have 1 column and the width would expand to 100% of the container.</li>
		<li>Once the defined columns are filled, the browser needs to put the remaining items somewhere so it will wrap them around, respecting the column definition, and fill them in as rows.</li>
		<li>Even though we did not define any rows, they will be implicitly created.</li>
		<li>Similarly, if you do define a set of grid rows, the extra items will fill themselves in automatically after they take up the space in the rows that have been explicitly defined.</li>
		<li>*Explain this example a little bit with pointer</li>
