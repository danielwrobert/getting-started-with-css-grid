	<ul>
		<li>I'm not going to cover this extensively but I do want to touch on the main difference between the two specifications.</li>
		<li>That is:
			<ul>
				<li>Flexbox takes a one-directional approach and gives the container element the ability to alter its items to best fill the available space</li>
				<li>With Flexbox, you control the directional flow to be either rows or columns.</li>
				<li>CSS Grid, on the other hand, takes a two-dimentional approach and allows you full control to place a container's items in BOTH rows and columns.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>While there is certainly some overlap and cases where you could use one or the other, there are also many cases where you would reach for one OVER the other.</li>
	</ul>
