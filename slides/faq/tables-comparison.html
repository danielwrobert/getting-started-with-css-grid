		<li>There are a few main reasons why you shouldn't use HTML tables for layouts and why CSS Grid is different:
			<ul>
				<li>HTML tables were designed for tabular data. Early on, people used them as a layout hack because CSS support across browsers was very poor.</li>
				<li>Using tables for layout reduces accessibility for visually impaired users - the output from screen-readers tends to be confusing for users because of the more complex markup.</li>
				<li>Because the markup structures tend to be more complex than proper layout techniques, this can result in code that is harder to maintain and debug.</li>
				<li>Lastly, tables are not automatically responsive: Proper layout containers default to 100% of the width of their parent element.</li>
				<li>Tables on the other hand are sized according to their content by default.</li>
				<li>Because of this, extra measures are needed to get a table-based layout to work across devices.</li>
			</ul>
