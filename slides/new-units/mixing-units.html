		<li>You don't have to stick with one measurement unit for your track definitions.</li>
		<li>You can, for example, mix pixels with the fr unit, like you see here. This can be handy if you want to have part of your grid take up a set amount of space and the rest of the grid to flex around it.</li>
		<li>The way this is calculated is the pixel values (the set/absolute space) are calculated first and then the items using `fr` are divided up with the remaining space. Another way to look at it is to think of `fr` as "Free Space", where the "Paid Space" is taken up first.</li>
