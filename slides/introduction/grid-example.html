	<ul>
		<li>The idea behind a grid is that you take an element on your page and set it as the "grid container".</li>
		<li>From there, you can slice up that container's contents into actual grid areas.</li>
		<li>Once you have your grid set and sliced, you can take the "grid items" (children elements to the container) and place them anywhere in the grid using the areas you've defined.</li>
		<li>You can do this without any need for positioning rules that we needed to rely on in the past (top, bottom, right, left, absolute, etc.).</li>
		<li>Much like Flexbox, the whole concept behind CSS Grid is all about the relationship between the container and the items.</li>
		<li>When you set an element to `display: grid;`, you automatically make all of it's direct children "grid items" of that container. The children items are not explicitly set as grid items - there is no `display: grid-item;` rule. This just happens automatically when the direct parent is set to `display: grid;`.</li>
