	<ul>
		<li>And just like that, we have a basic page layout.</li>
		<li>You may have noticed I mixed pixel and fr units to keep some of the elements locked in at a set height or width.</li>
		<li>The sidebar, for example, will stay at a fixed 200px width, while the content area will expand and take up the rest of the remaining space in the container.</li>
	</ul>
